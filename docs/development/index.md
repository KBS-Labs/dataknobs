## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: 3.10 or higher
- **Package Manager**: UV (fast Python package manager)
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Docker**: For running PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, and LocalStack services

### Quick Setup with UV

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dataknobs.git
cd dataknobs

# Install all dependencies
uv sync --all-packages

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

# Run quality checks before PRs
./bin/run-quality-checks.sh

# Or run tests directly
pytest
```

### Docker Services

The project uses Docker containers for development services:

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d postgres elasticsearch localstack

# Check service status
docker-compose ps

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

For more details, see the [UV Virtual Environment Guide](uv-environment.md) and [Quality Checks Process](quality-checks.md).

## Development Workflow

### 1. Issue Creation
- Use GitHub issues to track bugs, features, and improvements
- Follow issue templates for consistency
- Label issues appropriately
- Assign to milestones when relevant

### 2. Branch Management
- **main**: Stable, production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/***: Individual feature development
- **bugfix/***: Bug fixes
- **hotfix/***: Critical production fixes

### 3. Code Development
- Follow [Python PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guidelines
- Write comprehensive docstrings
- Include type hints
- Add appropriate tests
- Update documentation

### 4. Testing
- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Ensure integration tests pass
- Achieve minimum code coverage targets
- Test across supported Python versions

### 5. Review Process
- Create pull request with detailed description
- Request review from maintainers
- Address feedback and make necessary changes
- Ensure all checks pass

## Code Standards

### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8 coding style
- Use black for code formatting
- Use isort for import organization
- Use pylint for code quality checks

### Documentation

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
- Use generators for large dataset processing
- Implement proper resource cleanup
- Monitor memory usage in tests
- Consider lazy loading for large data structures

### Processing Efficiency
- Profile code performance regularly
- Use appropriate data structures
- Implement caching where beneficial
- Consider parallel processing for CPU-intensive tasks

### Scalability
- Design for horizontal scaling
- Use streaming processing for large files
- Implement proper error handling and recovery
- Consider database connection pooling

## Security Guidelines

### Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data before processing
- Use parameterized queries for databases
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

### Data Handling
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use HTTPS for all network communications
- Implement proper logging (avoid logging sensitive data)
- Follow data retention policies

### Dependencies
- Regularly update dependencies
- Use security scanning tools
- Pin dependency versions
- Review new dependencies for security issues

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**
   - Ensure packages are installed in development mode
   - Check Python path configuration
   - Verify virtual environment activation

2. **Test Failures**
   - Run tests individually to isolate issues
   - Check for test data dependencies
   - Verify mock configurations

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks
   - Check memory usage patterns
   - Review algorithm complexity

### Debugging Tools

```python
# Python debugger
import pdb; pdb.set_trace()

# Performance profiling
import cProfile
cProfile.run('your_function()')

# Memory profiling
from memory_profiler import profile
@profile
def your_function():
    pass
```
