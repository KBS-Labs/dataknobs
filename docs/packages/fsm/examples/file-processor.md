# File Processing Example

*Coming Soon*

This example will demonstrate how to build file processing workflows using the FSM framework, including:

- Reading and processing multiple file formats (CSV, JSON, XML)
- Batch processing of file directories
- Error handling for corrupted files
- Output transformation and validation
- Progress monitoring for large file sets

## Planned Features

- Support for common file formats
- Configurable processing pipelines
- Memory-efficient streaming for large files
- Parallel processing of multiple files
- Comprehensive error handling

Check back soon for the complete implementation!
