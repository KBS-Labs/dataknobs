# LLM Chain Processing Example

*To Be Implemented*

This example will demonstrate how to build multi-step LLM processing chains using the FSM framework, including:

- **Sequential LLM chains** where output of one LLM feeds into the next
- **Chain-of-thought reasoning** with step-by-step processing
- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** patterns with document retrieval
- **Prompt chaining** with context preservation
- **Response validation** and structured output parsing

## Planned Implementation

The example will showcase:

### Basic Chain Pattern
```python
# Sequential processing through multiple LLM steps
chain = LLMChain([
    ("summarize", "Summarize this text: {input}"),
    ("analyze", "Analyze the summary: {summary}"),
    ("conclusions", "Draw conclusions: {analysis}")
])
```

### RAG Pattern
- Document chunking and embedding
- Vector similarity search
- Context injection into prompts
- Source attribution

### Chain-of-Thought
- Breaking complex problems into steps
- Intermediate reasoning validation
- Final answer synthesis

## Implementation Priority

This example is scheduled for implementation in Phase 8 of the FSM project. It will demonstrate advanced LLM workflow patterns beyond simple conversation management.
