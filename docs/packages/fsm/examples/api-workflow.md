# API Orchestration Example

*Coming Soon*

This example will demonstrate how to orchestrate multiple API calls using the FSM framework, including:

- Sequential and parallel API calls
- Rate limiting and circuit breakers
- Request/response transformation
- Error recovery and retry logic
- Response aggregation

## Planned Features

- Multiple API endpoint integration
- Configurable retry strategies
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Rate limiting compliance
- Response caching and optimization

Check back soon for the complete implementation!
