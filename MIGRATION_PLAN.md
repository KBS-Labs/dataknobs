# Migration Plan: Transitioning MyProject to a Monorepo with uv

## Context
MyProject is a simple, open-source Python project with basic tools, currently managed as a single package using Poetry. It has a small user base, including some inactive but dependent users. The goal is to migrate to a monorepo structure with modular packages (e.g., `myproject-tool-a`, `myproject-tool-b`) while adopting `uv` for dependency and package management. This migration aims to improve modularity, maintainability, and interoperability without breaking compatibility for existing users.

## Objectives
1. **Modularity**: Split the single package into independent, reusable components.
2. **Compatibility**: Maintain a legacy `myproject` package to support existing users.
3. **Tooling Upgrade**: Replace Poetry with `uv` for faster dependency resolution and packaging.
4. **User Support**: Minimize disruption for active and inactive users with clear communication and a deprecation plan.
5. **Maintainability**: Use a monorepo to centralize tooling, testing, and documentation.

## Proposed Monorepo Structure

```
- **legacy/**: Mirrors the current `myproject` package, re-exporting functionality from new packages for compatibility.
- **tool-a/**, **tool-b/**: Modular packages for individual tools.
- **common/**: Shared utilities (if needed).
- **docs/**: Centralized documentation.
- **.github/workflows/**: CI/CD for testing and publishing.

## Migration Steps
1. **Plan and Design**:
   - Identify logical components (e.g., `tool-a`, `tool-b`) in the current `myproject` package.
   - Determine if shared code requires a `myproject-common` package.
2. **Set Up Monorepo**:
   - Create the directory structure above.
   - Initialize new packages with `uv init` in each `packages/*/` directory.
3. **Migrate to `uv`**:
   - Convert Poetryâ€™s `pyproject.toml` to `uv`-compatible format for each package.
   - Use `uv add` to manage dependencies and `uv lock` for consistent resolution.
4. **Refactor Code**:
   - Move code to `tool-a`, `tool-b`, and `common` packages.
   - Update imports (e.g., `from myproject_tool_a import func`).
   - Configure `legacy` package to re-export APIs from new packages.
5. **Update CI/CD**:
   - Replace Poetry-based GitHub Actions with `uv`-based workflows for testing and publishing.
   - Test all packages across supported Python versions (3.8â€“3.12).
6. **Update Documentation**:
   - Revise `README.md` and `docs/` to reflect the new structure.
   - Add migration guides for users.
   - Include deprecation notices for the `legacy` package.
7. **Test and Validate**:
   - Run unit and integration tests with `uv run pytest`.
   - Test installation of all packages locally (`uv build`, `pip install`).
   - Publish pre-release versions to TestPyPI for user feedback.
8. **Release**:
   - Release new packages (`myproject-tool-a`, `myproject-tool-b`, `myproject-common`) to PyPI.
   - Release updated `myproject` (legacy) package with pinned dependencies.
   - Announce the migration in release notes and community channels.
9. **Support Users**:
   - Monitor GitHub issues for feedback.
   - Plan to deprecate the `legacy` package after 6â€“12 months.

## Compatibility Strategy
- The `legacy` package (`myproject`) will:
  - Retain the original package name and functionality.
  - Depend on new packages (e.g., `myproject-tool-a==1.0.0`).
  - Include deprecation warnings in `README.md`, docstrings, and release notes.
- Users can continue using `pip install myproject` without changes.
- New users will be directed to install modular packages (e.g., `pip install myproject-tool-a`).

## Communication Plan
- **Release Notes**: Detail the migration, new packages, and deprecation plan.
- **Documentation**: Update `docs/` with installation instructions and migration guides.
- **Announcements**: Post to GitHub, PyPI, and community channels (e.g., X, mailing lists).
  > ðŸš€ MyProject is now a monorepo! Install `myproject-tool-a` and `myproject-tool-b` for modular usage. The `myproject` package remains for compatibility but will be deprecated in v2.0.0.

## Risks and Mitigations
- **User Disruption**: Mitigated by the `legacy` package and clear communication.
- **Testing Overhead**: Start with minimal integration tests, expanding as needed.
- **uv Learning Curve**: Use `uv`â€™s documentation and simple CLI; fall back to Poetry if issues arise.
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Pin versions in the `legacy` package and use `uv lock` for consistency.

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Plan components, set up monorepo, and migrate to `uv`.
- **Week 2**: Refactor code, configure `legacy` package, and update CI/CD.
- **Week 3**: Test locally, update documentation, and publish pre-releases to TestPyPI.
- **Week 4**: Release to PyPI, announce migration, and monitor user feedback.

## Tools
- **uv**: For dependency management and packaging.
- **hatchling**: Build backend for `pyproject.toml`.
- **pytest**: For unit and integration tests.
- **mkdocs**: For documentation.
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD.
- **black**, **isort**, **mypy**: For code quality.

This plan ensures a smooth transition to a modular, maintainable monorepo while supporting existing users and leveraging `uv`â€™s performance benefits.
