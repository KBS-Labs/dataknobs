## Technical Decisions

### Why Separate Vector Stores vs Database Integration?

**Separate Vector Stores** (Faiss, Chroma):
- Specialized for vector operations
- Better performance for pure vector workloads
- Advanced indexing algorithms
- Memory-efficient for large vector datasets

**Database Integration** (PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch):
- Unified data storage
- ACID transactions
- Complex queries combining structured data and vectors
- Existing infrastructure reuse

### Migration Path

1. **Development**: MemoryVectorStore
2. **Testing**: SQLite with basic vector support
