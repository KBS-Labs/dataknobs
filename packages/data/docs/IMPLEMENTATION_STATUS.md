   - Backend-to-backend data migration
   - Supports both async and sync databases
   - Batch processing with configurable size

   - Support for field operations (add, remove, rename, type changes)
   - Forward and backward migrations
   - Auto-detection of schema changes
   - JSON serialization for persistence

3. **DataTransformer** (`transformers.py`)
   - Field mapping and renaming
   - Value transformation with built-in transformers
   - Record filtering and transformation
   - Transformation pipelines for complex workflows
   - Common transformers: to_string, to_int, to_float, to_bool, parse_json, etc.

### Schema Validation ✅
Implemented robust schema validation in `src/dataknobs_data/validation/`:

   - Define record schemas with field definitions
   - Validate records against schemas
   - Type coercion support
   - Strict mode for rejecting extra fields
   - Schema versioning
   - Batch validation with caching

   - Custom constraint support
   - Detailed error messages
   - Serializable constraint definitions

3. **TypeCoercer** (`type_coercion.py`)
   - Intelligent type coercion between types
   - Support for common conversions (string ↔ int/float/bool/datetime)
   - JSON parsing and serialization
   - Custom coercion function registration
   - Handles edge cases gracefully

## Previously Completed (Phase 4 - Configuration Integration)

### Configuration System Integration ✅
All existing backends now fully support the DataKnobs configuration system:

1. **Memory Backend**
   - Inherits from `ConfigurableBase`
   - Implements `from_config()` classmethod
   - Supports Config.get_instance() construction

2. **File Backend**
   - Inherits from `ConfigurableBase`
   - Implements `from_config()` classmethod
   - Fixed CSV/Parquet format handlers to extract field values from nested dictionaries
   - Supports all file formats (JSON, CSV, Parquet) with configuration

3. **PostgreSQL Backend**
   - Inherits from `ConfigurableBase`
   - Implements `from_config()` classmethod
   - Integrates with sql_utils PostgresDB

4. **Elasticsearch Backend**
   - Inherits from `ConfigurableBase`
   - Implements `from_config()` classmethod
   - Integrates with elasticsearch_utils

### Data Consistency Fix ✅
- Resolved issue where CSV and Parquet formats were storing full field dictionaries instead of values
- Format handlers now properly extract values from both nested field dictionaries and simple values
- Ensures consistency across all file formats

### Documentation Enhancement ✅
Created comprehensive documentation for the configuration system:

1. **Main Configuration Documentation**
   - `/docs/development/configuration-system.md` - Complete overview and patterns
   - `/docs/development/adding-config-support.md` - Step-by-step implementation guide

2. **Package Documentation Updates**
   - Updated `/packages/data/README.md` with configuration examples
   - Updated main `/README.md` with data package and config usage
   - Updated `/docs/development/index.md` with links to new guides

3. **Integration Tests**
   - Created `/packages/data/tests/test_config_integration.py`
   - Tests all backends with Config.get_instance()
   - Verifies environment variable substitution

## Recently Completed (Phase 7 - Pandas Integration)

### Pandas Integration ✅
Implemented seamless integration between DataKnobs Records and Pandas DataFrames:

1. **DataFrameConverter** (`pandas/converter.py`)
   - Records to DataFrame conversion with type preservation
   - DataFrame to Records conversion with metadata preservation
   - Support for index preservation and custom options
   - Round-trip conversion accuracy

2. **TypeMapper** (`pandas/type_mapper.py`)
   - Bidirectional type mapping between FieldType and pandas dtypes
   - Intelligent type inference and coercion
   - Support for nullable types and special values
   - Custom converters for complex types

3. **BatchOperations** (`pandas/batch_ops.py`)
   - Bulk insert from DataFrame
   - Query results as DataFrame
   - Aggregation operations
   - Export to CSV/Parquet
   - Chunked processing for large datasets

4. **MetadataHandler** (`pandas/metadata.py`)
   - Multiple strategies for metadata preservation
   - Support for DataFrame.attrs, columns, or multi-index
   - Round-trip metadata preservation
   - Record ID tracking

5. **Record Enhancement**
   - Added first-class `id` property to Record class
   - Backward compatible with metadata-based IDs
   - UUID generation support
   - Proper ID handling in copy, merge, and project operations

### Test Results
- All 20 pandas integration tests passing
- Code coverage increased to 25% overall
- Pandas module coverage: 50-69% across components

## Next Phase: S3 Backend Implementation

### Design Principles
Following the established patterns:
1. **Keep it Simple** - S3 backend should be straightforward to use
2. **DRY Principle** - Reuse existing patterns from other backends
3. **Config Support from Start** - Implement ConfigurableBase inheritance immediately
4. **Real Implementations** - Use LocalStack for testing instead of mocks

### S3 Backend Requirements
1. **Core Features**
   - Connection management (boto3 client)
   - Object organization (prefix-based namespacing)
   - CRUD operations
   - Metadata storage as S3 tags
   - Batch operations for efficiency

2. **Configuration Support**
   ```yaml
   databases:
     - name: s3_storage
       class: dataknobs_data.backends.s3.S3Database
       bucket: ${S3_BUCKET:my-bucket}
       prefix: ${S3_PREFIX:records/}
       region: ${AWS_REGION:us-west-2}
       endpoint_url: ${S3_ENDPOINT}  # For LocalStack testing
   ```

3. **Authentication Options**
   - IAM roles (default in EC2/ECS)
   - Access keys (via environment variables)
   - Session tokens
   - LocalStack for testing

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Parallel uploads for batch operations
   - Multipart upload for large records
   - Client-side caching of frequently accessed records
   - Exponential backoff retry logic

### Implementation Plan
1. Create S3 backend class with ConfigurableBase
2. Implement basic CRUD operations
3. Add batch operations for efficiency
4. Create LocalStack-based integration tests
5. Add performance optimizations
6. Document usage and best practices

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests with mocked boto3 client
- Integration tests with LocalStack
- Performance benchmarks comparing with other backends
- Cost estimation utilities

## Backend Factory (After S3)

Once S3 is complete, implement the backend factory:
- Dynamic backend selection based on configuration
- Registry pattern for backend registration
- Factory inherits from FactoryBase
- Supports all existing backends (Memory, File, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, S3)

## Current Dependencies
```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    "dataknobs-config>=0.1.0",  # Configuration support
    "dataknobs-common>=0.1.0",
    "dataknobs-utils>=0.1.0",
    "pandas>=2.0.0",
    "pyarrow>=12.0.0",
    "psycopg2-binary>=2.9.0",
    "elasticsearch>=8.0.0",
    # boto3 will be added for S3
]
```

## Testing with UV
All tests should be run with `uv` to ensure proper dependency loading:
```bash
uv run pytest packages/data/tests/
```
