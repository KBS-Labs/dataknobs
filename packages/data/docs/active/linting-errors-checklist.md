# Data Package - Linting & Type Checking Errors Checklist

This document tracks specific errors that need to be addressed in the data package.

Last Updated: August 31, 2025

## Ruff Linting Errors Status (Completed August 2025)

### Summary
**Reduced from ~1500 → ~40 → 5-10 remaining stylistic errors** ✅

All functional Ruff errors have been resolved. Remaining errors are stylistic preferences that have been documented as acceptable in the project's linting configuration.

### Fixed in Final Cleanup ✅

#### Critical Functional Issues
- [x] **F811** - Duplicate method definitions - FIXED
- [x] **F821** - Undefined names - FIXED (added TYPE_CHECKING imports)
- [x] **F841** - Unused variables - FIXED (removed or used appropriately)
- [x] **F402** - Import shadowing - FIXED (renamed loop variables)
- [x] **B904** - Exception handling without `from` - FIXED
- [x] **PLE0704** - Bare raise statements - FIXED

#### Code Quality Improvements
- [x] **B027** - Empty base methods - FIXED (added `# noqa: B027` for intentional empty implementations)
- [x] **B007** - Unused loop variables - FIXED (removed unnecessary enumerate/items() calls)
- [x] **NPY002** - Legacy numpy random - FIXED (modernized to use np.random.default_rng())
- [x] **SIM101** - Multiple isinstance calls - FIXED (merged for clarity)
- [x] **PYI056** - __all__ modifications - FIXED (use += instead of append)
- [x] **PLW2901** - Loop variable overwrites - FIXED (and found a bug in python_vector_search.py!)
- [x] **TC001/003/004** - Type checking imports - FIXED (moved to TYPE_CHECKING blocks)

#### Bug Discovered and Fixed
- [x] **python_vector_search.py** - Record objects were being unnecessarily converted to dicts and back, potentially losing data

### Remaining Stylistic Errors (Ignored in pyproject.toml)

These have been evaluated and determined to be stylistic preferences that don't affect functionality:

- **SIM103** (2 instances) - Return negated condition directly - Sometimes clearer with if/else
- **SIM118** (5 instances) - Use `key in dict` instead of `key in dict.keys()` - Explicit can be clearer
- **PLW3301** (1 instance) - Nested max calls - More readable when nested
- **RUF006** (1 instance) - Store asyncio.create_task reference - Only needed if canceling
- **PLW0127** (1 instance) - Self-assignment - Documented with `# noqa` comment as intentional

## MyPy Type Checking Errors Status (Updated August 31, 2025)

### Summary
- **Total errors (comprehensive)**: 587 (with pyproject.toml, when mypy.ini is absent)
- **Critical errors (focused)**: 141 (with mypy.ini - used by default)
- **Reduction achieved**: 774 → 587 → 141 (by suppressing less critical issues)

### Major Accomplishments ✅

#### 1. Python 3.9 Compatibility - COMPLETED ✅
Fixed runtime errors on Python 3.9:

- [x] **Added `from __future__ import annotations`** to 49 files
- [x] **Fixed TypeError** - "unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'str' and 'NoneType'"
- [x] **All tests passing** on Python 3.9.6

#### 2. Unreachable Code (31 instances) - COMPLETED ✅
All unreachable code warnings have been resolved:

- [x] **Query Module** - Fixed exhaustive enum handling with `raise ValueError`
- [x] **Query Logic Module** - Replaced unreachable returns with proper error handling
- [x] **Validation Module** - Renamed `Any` class to `AnyOf` to avoid conflicts with `typing.Any`
- [x] **Type Annotations** - Added proper nullable type annotations (`| None`)
- [x] **False Positives** - Added `# type: ignore[unreachable]` for MyPy limitations with platform-specific code

#### 3. Type Stubs Installation - COMPLETED ✅
Added to dev-dependencies in pyproject.toml:

- [x] **pandas-stubs>=2.0.0**
- [x] **types-requests>=2.31.0**
- [x] **types-beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0**
- [x] **numpy>=1.24.0** (has built-in type stubs)

#### 4. Validation Module Improvements - COMPLETED ✅

- [x] **Renamed `Any` constraint to `AnyOf`** - Avoids name conflict with `typing.Any`
- [x] **Fixed Number type comparisons** - Added explicit float casts with type: ignore
- [x] **Updated all references** - In code, tests, and documentation

### MyPy Error Suppression Strategy - COMPLETED ✅

Created two-tier type checking approach:

1. **Focused Mode (`mypy.ini`)** - 141 critical errors:
   - `arg-type` (79) - Incorrect argument types
   - `return-value` (17) - Wrong return types
   - `operator` (12) - Unsupported operations
   - `call-arg` (9) - Invalid function arguments
   - Other critical issues

2. **Comprehensive Mode (`pyproject.toml`)** - 587 total errors:
   - Includes more type issues for gradual typing migration
   - Shows when mypy.ini is not present

**Suppressed in Focused Mode:**
- `attr-defined` (134) - Dynamic attribute access
- `no-untyped-def` (82) - Missing type annotations
- `union-attr` (76) - Union type attribute access
- `assignment` (62) - Type assignment mismatches
- `import-untyped` (59) - Missing py.typed markers
- `no-any-return` (44) - Returning Any
- `override` (25) - Method signature incompatibilities
- `var-annotated` (15) - Missing variable annotations

### Next Priority Areas

#### Priority 1: Add py.typed Marker 🔴
The package needs a `py.typed` marker file to indicate it supports type checking:
- [ ] Add empty `py.typed` file to package root
- [ ] This will resolve 59 `[import-untyped]` errors

#### Priority 2: Attribute Access Issues (133 instances) 🟠
Most common patterns needing type guards:
- [ ] Vector store operations on potentially None indices
- [ ] Collection operations on potentially None collections
- [ ] Add proper initialization checks and type guards

#### Priority 3: Missing Type Annotations (82 instances) 🟡
- [ ] Add return type annotations to public methods
- [ ] Add type hints to function arguments
- [ ] Focus on public API first, internal methods later

#### Priority 4: Union Type Handling (70 instances) 🟢
- [ ] Add proper type narrowing for union types
- [ ] Use isinstance checks before attribute access
- [ ] Consider using TypeGuard functions for complex cases

## Python 3.9 Compatibility Requirements

### Maintaining Compatibility Going Forward

To ensure continued Python 3.9 compatibility:

1. **Always add `from __future__ import annotations`** as the first import in any new Python file that uses type hints

2. **Use pipe union syntax (`|`) for type hints** instead of `Union` and `Optional`:
   ```python
   # Good - works with future annotations
   def func(param: str | None = None) -> list[int] | None:
       ...
   
   # Avoid - more verbose
   from typing import Optional, Union
   def func(param: Optional[str] = None) -> Optional[List[int]]:
       ...
   ```

3. **Test compatibility** by running tests with Python 3.9:
   ```bash
   uv run python --version  # Should show 3.10+
   python3.9 -m pytest tests/  # Test with system Python 3.9
   ```

4. **Type checking** should be done with `uv run mypy` to use project dependencies

### Files Requiring Future Annotations

All 49 data package source files now have `from __future__ import annotations`. Any new files added to the package should include this import.

## Development Commands

### Running Type Checks
```bash
# Focused check - only critical errors (141 errors) - DEFAULT
uv run mypy packages/data/src/dataknobs_data

# Comprehensive check - more type issues (587 errors)
# Must temporarily rename mypy.ini to use pyproject.toml settings
mv mypy.ini mypy.ini.bak && uv run mypy packages/data/src/dataknobs_data; mv mypy.ini.bak mypy.ini

# Check specific file
uv run mypy packages/data/src/dataknobs_data/validation/constraints.py
```

### Running Linting
```bash
# Ruff linting
uv run ruff check packages/data/src/dataknobs_data

# Auto-fix where possible
uv run ruff check --fix packages/data/src/dataknobs_data
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest packages/data/tests/

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest packages/data/tests/test_validation.py -v
```
