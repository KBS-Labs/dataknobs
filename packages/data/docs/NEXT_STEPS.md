# DataKnobs Data Package - Next Steps

## Current Status (August 17, 2025)

### üéâ Major Accomplishments This Session

1. **Batch Error Handling Consolidation (COMPLETED)**
   - Unified graceful fallback pattern across all backends
   - When batch operations fail, individual records are processed to identify specific failures
   - Only failing records are dropped, successful ones are preserved
   - Moved common batch utilities to streaming.py to reduce code duplication
   - All backends now inherit from StreamingMixin/AsyncStreamingMixin

2. **Record ID Management Centralization (COMPLETED)**
   - Centralized complex ID management in the Record class
   - ID can come from multiple sources (explicit ID, metadata, fields)
   - Handles DataFrames with 'id' or 'record_id' columns
   - Consistent ID resolution across all operations

3. **Pandas Integration Fixes (COMPLETED)**
   - Fixed all TypeMapper methods (infer_field_type, get_pandas_dtype, convert_value, etc.)
   - Added optimal dtype detection for memory efficiency
   - Fixed timezone handling for both pytz and standard library
   - Fixed BatchConfig validation and defaults
   - All pandas integration tests now passing

4. **Test Infrastructure Improvements (COMPLETED)**
   - Replaced mock databases with real implementations in tests (DRY principle)
   - Fixed circular import issues by consolidating code
   - Added update_batch method to all database base classes
   - Fixed DataFrame conversion to preserve column order and metadata

### Test Coverage Status
- **Overall**: ~85% (Target achieved! üéØ)
- **All Tests**: PASSING ‚úÖ
- **Key Improvements**:
  - Fixed all pandas integration test failures
  - Fixed all batch operation test failures  
  - Consolidated error handling across backends
  - Improved test reliability with real implementations

## üìç Current Position: Phase 10 - API Improvements Based on Real-World Testing

### What We Fixed Today

#### 1. Batch Error Handling Consistency
- **Problem**: SyncFileDatabase had graceful batch fallback, but AsyncFileDatabase and other backends didn't
- **Solution**: Created `process_batch_with_fallback` and `async_process_batch_with_fallback` in streaming.py
- **Impact**: All backends now handle batch failures consistently

#### 2. Code Duplication Across Backends
- **Problem**: Each backend had duplicate stream_write implementations
- **Solution**: Moved common logic to StreamingMixin and AsyncStreamingMixin
- **Impact**: DRY principle applied, easier maintenance

#### 3. Record ID Management Complexity
- **Problem**: ID could be in multiple places (_id, metadata['id'], fields['id'], fields['record_id'])
- **Solution**: Centralized ID resolution in Record.id property with priority order
- **Impact**: Consistent ID handling across all operations

#### 4. Missing Database Methods
- **Problem**: update_batch was missing from base classes and implementations
- **Solution**: Added update_batch to AsyncDatabase and SyncDatabase with default implementations
- **Impact**: Batch updates now work consistently

#### 5. Pandas Integration Issues
- **Problem**: Multiple missing methods in TypeMapper, wrong dtype optimization, timezone issues
- **Solution**: Implemented all missing methods, fixed dtype detection, handled timezone compatibility
- **Impact**: All pandas tests passing, ready for production use

## üéØ Current Work: API Improvements from Sensor Dashboard Example

### Completed: Sensor Dashboard Example Testing
‚úÖ Created comprehensive sensor monitoring example
‚úÖ 22 tests passing, exercising real-world scenarios  
‚úÖ Documented 8 major API improvements needed
‚úÖ Achieved 24% coverage through practical usage

### Priority 1: Fix Critical Nested Field Query Bug ‚úÖ COMPLETED
```python
# This now works correctly:
Filter("metadata.type", Operator.EQ, "sensor_reading")
Filter("device.info.manufacturer", Operator.EQ, "ACME")
```
- ‚úÖ Fixed `Record.get_value()` to support dot-notation paths
- ‚úÖ All database backends handle nested queries via Record.get_value()
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive tests for nested field access

### Priority 2: Implement Generic Range Operators ‚úÖ COMPLETED
```python
# Now supported:
Filter("timestamp", Operator.BETWEEN, (start_date, end_date))
Filter("price", Operator.BETWEEN, (100, 500))
Filter("name", Operator.BETWEEN, ("Alice", "David"))
```
- ‚úÖ Added BETWEEN and NOT_BETWEEN operators to Operator enum
- ‚úÖ Implemented type-aware range comparisons
- ‚úÖ Support numeric, temporal, and string ranges
- ‚úÖ Optimized PostgreSQL backend for native SQL BETWEEN

### Priority 3: Add Boolean Logic Operators ‚úÖ COMPLETED
```python
# Now supported:
Query().or_(
    Filter("sensor_id", Operator.EQ, "sensor_1"),
    Filter("sensor_id", Operator.EQ, "sensor_2")
)
```
- ‚úÖ Added OR, AND, NOT operators
- ‚úÖ Support grouped/nested conditions via ComplexQuery
- ‚úÖ Implemented QueryBuilder fluent API pattern
- ‚úÖ Shared implementation with backend override capability
- ‚úÖ Added `disconnect()` alias for all database backends

### Priority 4: Unify Batch Processing APIs
- [ ] Reconcile BatchConfig and StreamConfig interfaces
- [ ] Add list‚Üíasync iterable adapters for consistency
- [ ] Document when to use each configuration
- [ ] Add missing properties (total_batches, failed_indices)

### Priority 5: Improve Field Access Ergonomics
```python
# Enable intuitive access:
record["temperature"]  # Dict-like
record.temperature     # Attribute (optional)
record.to_dict()      # Simple values
```
- [ ] Add `__getitem__` for dict-like access
- [ ] Implement `to_dict()` method
- [ ] Consider `__getattr__` with careful design
- [ ] Maintain Field object access for metadata

## üìÖ Phase 11: Package Release (After API Improvements)

### Ready for Release Checklist
- ‚úÖ Test coverage ‚â• 85% overall
- ‚úÖ All tests passing
- ‚úÖ Batch error handling consolidated
- ‚úÖ Pandas integration complete
- ‚úÖ Connection pooling implemented
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated
- [ ] Final quality checks (mypy, ruff, black)
- [ ] Version bump to 1.0.0-rc1
- [ ] CHANGELOG updated
- [ ] Release notes prepared

## üîß Technical Decisions Made This Session

1. **Use Real Implementations Over Mocks**
   - Better test coverage of actual behavior
   - Catches integration issues early
   - Follows CLAUDE.md directive

2. **Consolidate Common Code**
   - Batch error handling in streaming.py
   - Mixin classes for shared functionality
   - DRY principle throughout

3. **Graceful Degradation Pattern**
   - Try batch operations first for performance
   - Fall back to individual operations on failure
   - Report specific failures while preserving successes

4. **Optional Dependencies**
   - pyarrow is optional (100+ MB dependency)
   - Tests skip gracefully when not installed
   - Modular design for different use cases

## üìö Key Code Patterns Established

### Batch Error Handling Pattern
```python
try:
    # Try batch operation first
    ids = batch_create_func(batch)
    result.successful += len(ids)
except Exception:
    # Fall back to individual operations
    for record in batch:
        try:
            single_create_func(record)
            result.successful += 1
        except Exception as e:
            result.failed += 1
            # Handle error based on config
```

### Record ID Resolution Priority
```python
1. Explicitly set ID (_id)
2. ID in metadata
3. ID field in record fields  
4. record_id field in record fields (DataFrames)
```

### Test Database Pattern
```python
class FailingDatabase(SyncMemoryDatabase):
    def create_batch(self, records):
        # Force individual processing
        raise ValueError("Batch disabled for testing")
```

## üöÄ Quick Start for Next Session

```bash
# 1. Navigate to package
cd ~/dev/kbs-labs/dataknobs/packages/data

# 2. Review API improvements needed
cat docs/API_IMPROVEMENTS.md

# 3. Run sensor dashboard example tests
uv run pytest tests/test_sensor_dashboard_example.py -v

# 4. Start with Priority 1: Fix nested field queries
# Begin in src/dataknobs_data/records.py - enhance get_value()
# Then update backends/memory.py search() method

# 5. Run tests to verify fixes
uv run pytest tests/ --cov=dataknobs_data --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Implementation Order
1. **Nested field queries** - Critical bug blocking intuitive usage
2. **Range operators** - Essential for time-series and numeric data
3. **Boolean logic** - Enables efficient complex queries
4. **Batch API unification** - Reduces developer confusion
5. **Field access improvements** - Better developer experience

## üí° Tips for Next Session

1. **If tests fail**: Check if it's a graceful fallback scenario
2. **For new features**: Add to appropriate mixin when possible
3. **For test improvements**: Use real databases, not mocks
4. **For performance**: Batch operations with graceful fallback
5. **For debugging**: Check Record.id resolution order
