# Changelog

All notable changes to the dataknobs-bots package will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `RAGKnowledgeBase.ingest_from_backend(backend, domain_id,
  config=None, progress_callback=None, extra_metadata=None)` —
  unified ingest for any `KnowledgeResourceBackend` (file, memory,
  S3) with full `KnowledgeBaseConfig` support: patterns, exclude
  patterns, per-pattern chunking overrides, streaming JSON/JSONL.
  When `config` is `None`, auto-loads
  `knowledge_base.(yaml|yml|json)` from the domain root (falling
  back to `_metadata/knowledge_base.*`); a malformed config raises
  `IngestionConfigError`. `extra_metadata` is merged onto every
  chunk — `KnowledgeIngestionManager` uses this to thread
  `{"domain_id": domain_id}` onto chunks so multi-tenant queries
  can filter on it.
- `IngestOrchestrator` (`dataknobs_bots.knowledge.orchestration`) —
  subscriber-side primitive that listens on an `EventBus` trigger
  topic and dispatches to
  `KnowledgeIngestionManager.ingest_if_changed`. Concurrent triggers
  for the same `domain_id` are serialized via a per-domain
  `asyncio.Lock`; different domains proceed in parallel. Stateless
  across restarts; trigger adapters (S3/SQS/cron → bus) remain
  consumer responsibility.
- `BackendDocumentSource` (re-exported from
  `dataknobs_xization.ingestion`) — adapts any
  `KnowledgeResourceBackend` to the `DocumentSource` protocol.
  Derives a common literal prefix from configured patterns and
  passes it to `backend.list_files(prefix=...)` so S3 (and any
  other prefix-aware backend) can avoid listing the whole bucket.
- `KnowledgeIngestionManager.ingest_if_changed(domain_id,
  last_version=None)` returning `IngestionResult | None` —
  returns `None` (and skips the ingest) when `last_version` is
  supplied and the backend reports no changes.

### Changed
- `KnowledgeIngestionManager.ingest()` delegates to
  `RAGKnowledgeBase.ingest_from_backend` and threads
  `{"domain_id": domain_id}` into per-chunk metadata so downstream
  queries can filter by tenant.
