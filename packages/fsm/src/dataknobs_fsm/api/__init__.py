"""Public APIs for FSM operations across different use cases.

This package provides three tiers of FSM APIs to suit different needs:

- **simple**: SimpleFSM - Synchronous interface for scripts and prototypes
- **async_simple**: AsyncSimpleFSM - Async interface for production applications
- **advanced**: AdvancedFSM - Advanced control with debugging and profiling

Each tier balances ease-of-use with control and performance capabilities.
See individual module documentation for detailed usage information.
