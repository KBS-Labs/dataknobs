"""Pre-configured FSM patterns for common workflow use cases.

This package provides ready-to-use FSM patterns implementing common
data processing and orchestration workflows:

- **etl**: Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipelines
- **api_orchestration**: API call orchestration with retries and rate limiting
- **error_recovery**: Error handling and resilience patterns
- **file_processing**: File and stream processing patterns

Each pattern provides factory functions that create configured FSM
instances for specific use cases.
