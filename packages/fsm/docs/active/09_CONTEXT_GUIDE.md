## Working Guidelines

### Daily Workflow
1. **Start**: Check 07_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md for current priorities
2. **Before coding**: Review relevant section in 06_LEARNINGS.md
3. **Design decisions**: Consult 08_ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md
4. **Implementation**: Follow patterns established in ADRs
5. **Testing**: Use real implementations (ADR-005)
6. **Update**: Mark progress in this document and 07_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md

### When Stuck
1. **Check learnings**: 06_LEARNINGS.md - "Common Pitfalls"
2. **Review decisions**: 08_ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md for design rationale
3. **Original intent**: 05_UPDATED_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for requirements
4. **Current state**: 07_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md for known issues

### Adding New Features
1. **Check ADRs**: Ensure alignment with architectural decisions
2. **Apply learnings**: Avoid pitfalls documented in 06_LEARNINGS.md
3. **Update status**: Add to 07_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
4. **Document decisions**: Create new ADR if significant
