  - *When to reference*: For detailed phase requirements and original design intentions
  - *Status*: Phases 1-6 complete, Phase 7 in progress, Phases 8-10 pending

### Current State Documents (06-08)
These capture the current reality and learnings:

- **06_LEARNINGS.md**: Implementation insights from Phase 7
  - *When to reference*: Before making design decisions or fixing bugs
  - *Key sections*: Common Pitfalls, Architectural Decisions, Testing Strategy

- **07_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md**: Current project snapshot

### Step 2: Complete Phase 7 (Priority 1 - CURRENT)
**Reference**: 05.UPDATED_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md - "Phase 7" section (lines 443-547)

**Completed Tasks:**

- [ ] Example implementations in `examples/` directory

## Working Guidelines

### Daily Workflow
1. **Start**: Check 07_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md for current priorities
2. **Before coding**: Review relevant section in 06_LEARNINGS.md
3. **Design decisions**: Consult 08_ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md
4. **Implementation**: Follow patterns established in ADRs
5. **Testing**: Use real implementations (ADR-005)
6. **Update**: Mark progress in this document and 07_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md

### When Stuck
1. **Check learnings**: 06_LEARNINGS.md - "Common Pitfalls"
2. **Review decisions**: 08_ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md for design rationale
3. **Original intent**: 05_UPDATED_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for requirements
4. **Current state**: 07_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md for known issues

### Adding New Features
1. **Check ADRs**: Ensure alignment with architectural decisions
2. **Apply learnings**: Avoid pitfalls documented in 06_LEARNINGS.md
3. **Update status**: Add to 07_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
4. **Document decisions**: Create new ADR if significant
