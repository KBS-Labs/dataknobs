- **Dual Execution Modes**: Full support for both sync and async execution with configurable strategies
- **Enterprise Patterns**: 15+ production-ready patterns including ETL, API orchestration, and error recovery
- **Resource Management**: Sophisticated pooling, lifecycle management, and cleanup with state/arc merging
- **LLM Integration**: Native support for OpenAI, Anthropic, and HuggingFace providers
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 90%+ code coverage with unit, integration, and performance tests
- **Hybrid Data Handling**: Intelligent data format adaptation supporting both dict and attribute access patterns
- **Unified Function Management**: Single system handling all function types with signature detection and adaptation
- **Enhanced Validation**: Pre and post validators with proper execution ordering
- **Shared Variables**: Cross-state communication and data caching capabilities
- **Deterministic Arc Selection**: Priority-based with definition order as tiebreaker

## Core Concepts

### 1. FSM Definition (Class-like)

An FSM definition acts as a template, similar to a class definition in OOP:
- Defines state networks containing states and arcs (transitions)
- Can be instantiated multiple times with different input data
- Represented as a directed graph of potential transitions
- Supports composition through push arcs and network references

### 2. State Networks

A state network is a labeled collection of states connected by arcs:

- **Label**: String identifier for reference (e.g., "main", "validation", "processing")
- **States**: One or more states with at least one start and one end state
- **Arcs**: Transitions between states, including special "push" arcs to other networks
- **Metadata**: Optional hints for execution strategy selection
- **Resource Requirements**: Network-level resource specifications

### 3. States

Each state definition includes:

- **Name**: String identifier (e.g., "validate", "process", "complete")
- **Input Schema**: Expected data structure using dataknobs_data.Field definitions
- **Pre-Validators**: Functions that validate incoming data before transforms are applied
- **StateTransform Functions**: Optional data transformations executed when entering the state
- **Post-Validators**: Functions that validate data after transforms, before arc evaluation
- **State Test**: Boolean function validating if data meets state conditions
- **Start/End Designation**: Boolean flags for start/end states
- **End State Test**: For end states, returns one of:
  - CANNOT_END: State cannot terminate
  - CAN_END: State may continue or terminate
  - MUST_END: State must terminate
- **Outgoing Arcs**: Zero or more transitions to other states
- **Resource Requirements**: State-specific resource needs
- **Error Handlers**: Optional error recovery specifications

### 4. Arcs (Transitions)

First-class objects defining transitions:

- **Target State**: Destination state reference
- **Pre-test Function**: Optional validation before transition
- **ArcTransform Function**: Optional data transformation during arc traversal
- **Priority**: Numeric priority for arc selection (0-100)
- **Definition Order**: Order in which arc was defined (for stable sorting when priorities are equal)
- **Resource Requirements**: Arc-specific resource needs (additive to state resources)
- **Push Arc Type**: Special arc that:
  - Executes another state network
  - Returns control to specified state upon completion
  - Supports nested execution contexts
  - Maintains parent-child history relationships

### 5. Validation Functions

The FSM supports two types of validators that execute at different points in the state lifecycle:

#### Pre-Validators
- **When**: Executed immediately upon entering a state, before transforms
- **Purpose**: Validate incoming data meets state requirements
- **Signature**: `validate(data: Dict[str, Any], context: FunctionContext) -> bool`
- **Configuration**: Via `state.pre_validators`
- **Behavior**: If any pre-validator returns False, transforms are skipped and transition fails
- **Example Use Cases**:
  - Check required fields are present
  - Validate data types and formats
  - Ensure business rules are met before processing

#### Post-Validators
- **When**: Executed after transforms, before arc evaluation
- **Purpose**: Validate transformed data before determining next state
- **Signature**: `validate(data: Dict[str, Any], context: FunctionContext) -> bool`
- **Configuration**: Via `state.validators`
- **Example Use Cases**:
  - Verify transform results are valid
  - Ensure data meets exit criteria
  - Validate consistency after modifications

### 6. Transform Functions

The FSM supports two distinct types of data transformation functions, clearly separated in purpose and execution:

#### StateTransforms
- **When**: Executed after pre-validators pass, when entering a state
- **Purpose**: Prepare/normalize data for state operations
- **Signature**: `transform(state: State) -> Dict[str, Any]`
- **Configuration**: Via `state.transforms`
- **Example Use Cases**:
  - Data normalization and validation
  - Format conversion (JSON to internal format)
  - Adding computed fields
  - Data enrichment from external sources
  - Preparing data for state-specific operations

#### ArcTransforms
- **When**: Executed during arc traversal (transition between states)
- **Purpose**: Transform data as it flows between states
- **Signature**: `transform(data: Any, context: FunctionContext) -> Any`
- **Configuration**: Via `arc.transform`
- **Example Use Cases**:
  - Data filtering and projection
  - Conditional data modification
  - State-specific data preparation
  - Data routing and splitting
  - Inter-state data flow transformations

#### Complete Execution Pipeline
```
Enter State → Allocate Resources → Pre-Validators → StateTransform → Post-Validators → Arc Evaluation → ArcTransform → Next State
```

##### Detailed State Entry Flow:
1. **Resource Allocation**: State resources are allocated once on entry
2. **Pre-Validation**: Validate incoming data (failure skips transforms)
3. **State Transforms**: Process/normalize data (if pre-validators pass)
4. **Post-Validation**: Validate transformed data before arc evaluation
5. **Arc Selection**: Evaluate arc conditions (sorted by priority, then definition order)
6. **Arc Execution**: Apply arc transforms with merged state+arc resources
7. **State Transition**: Move to next state and repeat

#### Function Types

The FSM supports four types of function references:

1. **inline** - Lambda expressions or code strings
   - Quick prototyping and simple logic
   - Defined directly in configuration
   - Example: `"lambda state: state.data.upper()"`

2. **builtin** - Pre-registered FSM library functions
   - Common operations provided by the framework
   - Referenced by name
   - Example: `{"type": "builtin", "name": "uppercase"}`

3. **custom** - Functions from importable modules
   - Complex logic in separate Python files
   - Requires module path
   - Example: `{"type": "custom", "module": "myapp.transforms", "name": "process"}`

4. **registered** - User-registered functions (Added in v2.0)
   - Clean Python functions registered at runtime
   - No module path required
   - Full IDE support and debugging
   - Example: `{"type": "registered", "name": "validate_email"}`

#### Custom Function Registration

Custom functions can be registered when creating an FSM instance:

```python
from dataknobs_fsm.api.simple import SimpleFSM

def validate_email(state):
    """Custom validation function."""
    data = state.data.copy()
    # validation logic here
    return data

def normalize_data(state):
    """Custom normalization function."""
    data = state.data.copy()
    # normalization logic here
    return data

# Register functions with FSM
fsm = SimpleFSM(
    config,
    custom_functions={
        'validate_email': validate_email,
        'normalize_data': normalize_data
    }
)
```

#### Configuration Examples

**StateTransform Configuration**:
```yaml
states:
  - name: process_data
    functions:
      transform: 
        type: inline
        code: "lambda state: {'normalized': state.data['raw'].upper()}"
    # OR with registered function
    functions:
      transform:
        type: registered
        name: "normalize_data"
```

**ArcTransform Configuration**:
```yaml
states:
  - name: source_state
    arcs:
      - target: target_state
        transform:
          type: inline
          code: "lambda data, ctx: {'processed': data['value'] * 2}"
        # OR with registered function
        transform:
          type: registered
          name: "process_transition"
```

This clear separation was formalized in ADR-027 after initial confusion led to execution issues. The architecture ensures each transform type executes exactly once at the appropriate time.

### 7. Execution Context

Maintains execution environment and state:

- **Unique Execution ID**: UUID for tracking
- **Input Data**: Original and transformed data
- **Resource Manager**: Handles resource acquisition/release
- **Execution History**: Complete audit trail
- **Shared Variables**: Cross-state communication and data caching
  - Accessible via `context.variables` dictionary
  - Persists across state transitions
  - Available to all functions via `FunctionContext.variables`
  - Supports network-scoped variables for sub-FSMs
- **Error Stack**: Error tracking and recovery
- **Metrics**: Performance and usage statistics

### 8. Function Context

Context passed to all FSM functions providing access to execution environment:

```python
@dataclass
class FunctionContext:
    state_name: str              # Current state name
    function_name: str           # Function being executed
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]     # Function metadata
    resources: Dict[str, Any]    # Allocated resources (state + arc)
    variables: Dict[str, Any]    # Shared variables for cross-state communication
    network_name: str | None     # Current network for variable scoping
```

Key features:
- **Unified Interface**: All functions receive the same context structure
- **Resource Access**: Functions can access allocated resources
- **Variable Sharing**: Enable data caching and inter-state communication
- **Network Awareness**: Support for scoped variables in sub-networks

### 9. Execution History

Comprehensive tracking system:

- **Tree Structure**: Hierarchical representation of execution paths
- **Multiple Paths**: Supports both successful and failed branches
- **Timestamps**: Detailed timing for each step
- **Data Snapshots**: Optional data capture at each state
- **Error Details**: Complete error information with stack traces
- **Resource Usage**: Tracks resource acquisition/release
- **Storage Strategies**: Pluggable backends (memory, database, file)

## Implementation Details

### Data Operation Modes

The FSM supports three distinct data operation modes, each optimized for different use cases:

#### 1. Copy Mode (Default)
- Data is copied from source before processing
- All operations performed on the copy
- Original data remains unchanged until explicit commit
- Enables safe concurrent processing
- Higher memory usage but safer

#### 2. Reference Mode
- Works with references to data (database row IDs, file offsets)
- Implements optimistic locking for database records
- Lazy loading of actual data when needed
- Lower memory footprint
- Suitable for large datasets

#### 3. Direct Mode
- Operates directly on source data
- No concurrency support
- Lowest memory usage
- Fastest for single-threaded operations
- Requires exclusive access

### Transaction Management

Sophisticated transaction handling for data consistency:

```python
class TransactionStrategy(Enum):
    SINGLE = "single"        # Commit each record immediately
    BATCH = "batch"         # Batch commits at intervals
    MANUAL = "manual"       # Explicit commit control
    TWO_PHASE = "two_phase" # Two-phase commit for distributed
```

Configuration options:
- Batch size control
- Temporary staging storage
- Configurable isolation levels
- Automatic rollback on failure

### Execution Strategies

The FSM supports multiple execution strategies, configurable at runtime:

#### 1. Traditional Traversal Strategies
- **Depth-First**: Explores deeply before backtracking
- **Breadth-First**: Explores all branches at same level
- **Priority-Based**: Follows arc priorities
- **Resource-Optimized**: Minimizes resource usage
- **Stream-Optimized**: Optimized for streaming data

#### 2. Sophisticated Scoring System
Multi-factor scoring considering:
- Arc priority (0-100 scale)
- Resource availability
- Historical success rates
- Load balancing across workers
- Network affinity

#### 3. Hybrid Mode
Combines traditional strategies with scoring for optimal performance

### Resource Management

Comprehensive resource lifecycle management with first-class resource support:

#### Resource Interface
```python
class IResource(ABC):
    """Base interface for external resources."""
    @abstractmethod
    async def acquire(self) -> Any:
        """Acquire resource connection/handle."""
    @abstractmethod
    async def release(self) -> None:
        """Release resource."""
    @abstractmethod
    def validate_health(self) -> bool:
        """Check if resource is healthy."""
```

#### Built-in Resource Types
- **DatabaseResource**: Pooled database connections with transaction support
- **FileSystemResource**: File system access with temporary file management
- **HTTPServiceResource**: HTTP clients with connection pooling and retry logic
- **LLMResource**: LLM provider access with rate limiting and fallbacks
- **VectorStoreResource**: Vector database connections for embeddings
- **Memory Buffers**: Managed memory allocation with limits

#### Resource Pooling
- Configurable min/max pool sizes
- Acquisition timeouts
- Idle timeout and eviction
- Health checking and validation
- Metrics tracking

#### Lifecycle Management
- **State Resources**: Allocated once when entering a state, shared by all state functions
- **Arc Resources**: Allocated during arc execution, additive to state resources
- **Resource Merging**: Arc resources complement (don't replace) state resources
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Resources released on state exit or error
- **Conflict Resolution**: State resources take precedence when names conflict
- **Graceful Shutdown**: All resources properly released on FSM termination

### Error Handling and Recovery

Multi-level error handling strategy with clear distinction between error types:

#### Error Classification

1. **Deterministic Errors** (No Retry)
   - `TypeError`, `AttributeError`, `ValueError`, `SyntaxError`
   - Code errors in user functions
   - Schema validation failures
   - These fail immediately without retry

2. **Potentially Recoverable Errors** (Retry with Backoff)
   - Network timeouts
   - Resource temporarily unavailable
   - Transient service failures
   - Configurable retry with exponential backoff

3. **Function Errors** (Special Handling)
   - Custom `FunctionError` exception for user function failures
   - State transform failures: State marked as failed, execution continues
   - Arc transform failures: Transition prevented, stays in source state

#### Transform Failure Behavior

**State Transform Failures**:
- State is marked as failed in context
- Execution continues to allow recovery paths
- Failed states tracked in `context.failed_states`
- Useful for validation pipelines where you want to collect all errors

**Arc Transform Failures**:
- Transition is prevented
- FSM remains in source state
- Alternative arcs may be attempted
- Returns error result if no valid transitions

#### 1. Function-Level
- Try-catch with intelligent retry logic
- Exponential backoff for recoverable errors
- No retry for deterministic failures
- Dead letter queues for persistent failures

#### 2. State-Level
- Error states for recovery
- Fallback states
- Compensation logic
- Failed state tracking

#### 3. Network-Level
- Error networks for complex recovery
- Circuit breakers
- Bulkhead isolation

#### 4. Execution-Level
- Global error handlers
- Error aggregation
- Partial success handling

### Streaming Support

Native streaming capabilities:

#### Stream Sources
- Database cursors
- File streams
- HTTP streams
- Message queues
- Custom sources

#### Stream Processing
- Windowing operations
- Batching and buffering
- Backpressure handling
- Progress tracking

#### Stream Sinks
- Database bulk inserts
- File writers
- HTTP endpoints
- Custom sinks

## Patterns and Use Cases

### Validated Use Cases

The FSM design was validated through three comprehensive use cases that drove key design decisions:

#### 1. Database Record Processing
**Key Requirements**:
- Concurrent processing with data safety
- Batch transaction management
- Staging support for complex transformations

**Design Impact**:
- Led to three data operation modes (Copy/Reference/Direct)
- Drove transaction strategy pattern implementation
- Validated resource manager design

```python
# Example: Database ETL with staging
fsm = FSM.from_yaml("database_processor.yaml")
config = ExecutionConfig(
    data_mode=DataMode.COPY,
    transaction_strategy="batch",
    batch_size=100
)
async with fsm.create_executor(config) as executor:
    records = await executor.fetch_input(source="source_db")
    results = await executor.process_batch(records)
    # Results automatically committed based on config
```

#### 2. Large File Streaming
**Key Requirements**:
- Process files larger than memory
- Chunk-based processing with parallelism
- Progress tracking and resumability

**Design Impact**:
- Native streaming support with backpressure
- Reference mode for memory efficiency
- Chunk management and parallel processing

```python
# Example: Streaming large file processing
stream_config = StreamConfig(
    chunk_size=10000,
    parallel_chunks=4,
    memory_limit="1GB"
)
async with fsm.create_stream_processor(stream_config) as processor:
    async for result_chunk in processor.process_file(input_path, output_path):
        print(f"Processed {result_chunk.record_count} records")
```

#### 3. LLM Conversation Processing
**Key Requirements**:
- Multiple external service integration
- Dynamic path selection based on data
- Sophisticated error recovery
- Result caching and validation

**Design Impact**:
- First-class resource management system
- Conditional arc execution
- Multi-level error handling
- Composable transform pattern

```python
# Example: LLM workflow with resources
resources = ResourceManager()
resources.register("llm", LLMResource(model="gpt-4"))
resources.register("vector_store", VectorStoreResource())

fsm = FSM.from_yaml("llm_processor.yaml", resources=resources)
result = await fsm.process({
    "conversation_id": conversation_id,
    "user_input": user_input
})
```

### Enterprise Patterns

Based on validated use cases, the following patterns were implemented:

### 1. ETL Pipeline
```python
fsm = ETLPattern()
    .extract_from(source="database")
    .transform(rules=[...])
    .validate(schema=...)
    .load_to(destination="warehouse")
    .build()
```

### 2. API Orchestration
```python
fsm = APIOrchestrationPattern()
    .with_circuit_breaker(threshold=5)
    .with_retry(max_attempts=3)
    .with_timeout(seconds=30)
    .orchestrate(apis=[...])
    .build()
```

### 3. LLM Workflow
```python
fsm = LLMWorkflowPattern()
    .with_provider("openai")
    .with_embedding_cache()
    .with_vector_search()
    .process_documents(docs=[...])
    .build()
```

### 4. Error Recovery
```python
fsm = ErrorRecoveryPattern()
    .with_retry_strategy(exponential_backoff)
    .with_dead_letter_queue()
    .with_compensation(rollback_fn)
    .build()
```

### 5. File Processing
```python
fsm = FileProcessingPattern()
    .read_files(pattern="*.csv")
    .validate_schema(schema)
    .transform(processors=[...])
    .aggregate(by="category")
    .write_output(format="parquet")
    .build()
```

### Design Validation Insights

The use case analysis validated and refined several key design aspects:

1. **Complexity Management**: Keep simple things simple through layered APIs
2. **Composability**: Small, focused transforms that combine for complex behavior
3. **Configuration-Driven**: Behavior controlled by configuration, not code changes
4. **Resource Abstraction**: Complex service interactions hidden behind clean interfaces
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Structure in YAML, logic in pluggable functions

- **Minimal Mocking**: Mock only external dependencies (databases, APIs)
- **Integration Focus**: Tests should exercise real code paths
- **User-Centric**: Test how developers will actually use the API
- **DRY Principle**: Reuse existing implementations rather than creating test-specific versions
- **Bug Discovery**: Tests uncovered and fixed real issues (e.g., FSM.execute() parameter bug)

### Testing Tools
- pytest for test execution
- pytest-asyncio for async tests
- pytest-benchmark for performance
- pytest-cov for coverage
- hypothesis for property testing

## Performance Considerations

- Network transition: < 5ms average

## API Refactoring for Zero Duplication

A major refactoring was undertaken to eliminate code duplication between the Simple and Advanced APIs. This effort resulted in zero code duplication and improved maintainability.

### Refactoring Components Created

#### ContextFactory
- **Purpose**: Centralized context creation patterns
- **Location**: `core/context_factory.py`
- **Functionality**:
  - Data conversion (dict → Record)
  - Initial state determination logic
  - Context creation with proper modes
  - State instance creation logic
- **Test Coverage**: 83%

#### ResultFormatter
- **Purpose**: Standardized result formatting across all APIs
- **Location**: `core/result_formatter.py`
- **Functionality**:
  - Formatting for sync/async execution results
  - Formatting for batch execution results
  - Formatting for stream execution results
  - Consistent error handling
- **Test Coverage**: 100%

#### Enhanced ExecutionContext
- Added `get_complete_path()` method for path construction
- Improved state management with dual tracking
- Better initialization methods
- Eliminated path construction duplication

#### ResourceManager Enhancements
- Added factory methods for provider creation
- `create_provider_from_dict()` method
- `create_simple_provider()` method
- Removed resource creation logic from APIs

### Refactoring Impact

**Before Refactoring**:
- Duplicated resource creation logic in Simple API
- Complex context initialization patterns in both APIs
- Identical result formatting logic duplicated between sync/async
- State resolution logic duplicated across APIs

**After Refactoring**:
- Zero code duplication between APIs
- Consistent patterns across codebase
- All APIs use same underlying infrastructure
- New features automatically benefit all APIs

## Implementation Learnings

### Key Technical Learnings

#### 1. Configuration Format Flexibility
**Learning**: Supporting multiple configuration formats improves usability
- Users naturally want network-level arc definitions with 'from'/'to' syntax
- Solution: Transform network arcs to state-level arcs internally
- Insight: Internal representation can differ from user-facing format

#### 2. Sync/Async API Consistency
**Learning**: Mixed sync/async APIs create integration challenges
- Problem: ExecutionEngine.execute was synchronous but SimpleFSM needed async
- Solution: Added execute_async method while keeping sync version
- Insight: Provide both sync and async versions when building frameworks

#### 3. Arc Registration Architecture
**Learning**: Arcs need registration at multiple levels for proper execution
- Problem: Arcs added to states but not network.arcs registry
- Solution: Modified FSMBuilder to register arcs in both places
- Insight: State machines need both local (state) and global (network) arc visibility

#### 4. StateTransform vs ArcTransform Clarity
**Learning**: Clear distinction needed between transform types
- StateTransforms execute on state entry
- ArcTransforms execute during transitions
- Execution order: Input → StateTransform → State Processing → ArcTransform → Next State
- Each serves distinct purposes in the data flow

**Resolution Journey**:
- Initial confusion caused ArcTransforms to not execute
- Function registry lookup issues between `transforms` and `functions` registries
- Duplicate StateTransform execution in some paths
- Fixed by passing FunctionRegistry object to ArcExecution
- Maintained backward compatibility with dict-based registries
- Added comprehensive test coverage for both transform types

#### 5. Resource Management Abstraction
**Learning**: Abstraction should simplify, not eliminate features
- Keep ResourceManager but simplify resource provider creation
- Provide factory methods for common resources
- Allow advanced users full control when needed

#### 6. Custom Function Registration
**Learning**: String-based function definitions are painful for users
- Users want to write Python functions, not strings
- IDE support (syntax highlighting, debugging) is crucial
- Function registration must be simple and intuitive

**Resolution Journey**:
- Discovered users were forced to write complex lambdas as strings
- Added `custom_functions` parameter to SimpleFSM
- Introduced "registered" function type to schema
- Fixed function name preservation through wrapping process
- Result: Clean, maintainable, debuggable function definitions

#### 7. Error Handling Granularity
**Learning**: Different error types need different handling strategies
- Deterministic errors (code bugs) should never retry
- Network/resource errors may benefit from retry
- Transform failures need special handling based on type

**Resolution Journey**:
- Initially all errors were retried equally
- Added FunctionError exception for deterministic failures
- Separated state transform failures (continue execution) from arc transform failures (prevent transition)
- Result: Intelligent error handling that matches user expectations

### Common Pitfalls Avoided

1. **Over-Mocking**: Using real implementations with simpler backends
2. **Tight Coupling**: Keeping layers properly separated through interfaces
3. **Missing Core Methods**: Ensuring complete APIs even if not initially used
4. **Parameter Inconsistency**: Aligning parameter names across components
5. **Schema Confusion**: Clear distinction between schema definitions and instances

### Development Process Insights

1. **Iterative Refinement**: Initial implementations needed multiple passes
2. **Test-Driven Debugging**: Tests revealed integration issues early
3. **User-Centric Design**: API design driven by actual usage patterns
4. **Consistency Matters**: Naming and patterns uniform throughout
5. **Documentation as Code**: Docs kept in sync with implementation

### 5. Simplified Complexity Pattern

The FSM maintains simplicity through architectural patterns validated by use cases:

### 6. Core Design Principles

Based on architectural decisions and implementation experience:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep configuration, execution, and resources separate
2. **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused interfaces over large, general ones
3. **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
4. **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
5. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Extract common patterns
6. **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Don't add complexity until actually needed
7. **Fail Fast**: Validate early and provide clear errors
8. **Explicit over Implicit**: Make behavior obvious and predictable

#### Separation of Concerns
```yaml
# Structure in YAML
states:
  - name: "process"
    transform:
      class: "custom.MyTransform"  # Logic in code
```

#### Resource Abstraction
```python
# Complex service interaction hidden behind resource interface
class LLMResource(IResource):
    async def call(self, prompt: str) -> str:
        # All complexity (retry, rate limiting, etc.) here
        return await self._client.generate(prompt)
```

#### Composable Transforms
```python
# Small, focused transforms that combine for complex behavior
PromptBuilder -> ConceptExtractor -> VectorSearch -> LLMCaller
```

#### Configuration-Driven Behavior
```yaml
# Behavior controlled by configuration, not code changes
error_handling:
  max_retries: 3
  retry_delay: 2
  fallback_states: true
```

## Key Learnings

### Implementation Insights

1. **Async Execution Needs True Concurrency**: Using run_in_executor for sync functions in async engine adds overhead without benefits
2. **Transform Placement Matters**: StateTransforms when entering states, ArcTransforms during transitions
3. **History Structure Choice**: Trees simpler than graphs for execution history
4. **Resource Lifecycle Critical**: Proper cleanup prevents resource leaks
5. **Scoring System Flexibility**: Multi-factor scoring enables sophisticated routing
6. **Data Format Consistency**: Functions need predictable data formats - mixing dict/object access causes failures
7. **Signature Detection Value**: Detecting function signatures enables automatic adaptation to different calling patterns
8. **Wrapper Hierarchy Management**: Clear ownership of wrapping prevents double-wrapping issues
9. **Inline Function Support**: Supporting inline lambdas critical for configuration simplicity
10. **Cache Everything**: Function compilation and wrapper creation should be cached for performance

### Technical Debt Resolution

1. **Data Handling Inconsistency**: Resolved through FSMData wrapper and hybrid approach
2. **Function Double Wrapping**: Fixed by tracking wrapped state
3. **Signature Mismatch**: Solved with intelligent signature detection
4. **Type Checking Burden**: Eliminated through consistent data handling
