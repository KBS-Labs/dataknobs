## ℹ️ NON-ACTIONABLE Items (By Design)

### Provider Limitations

### Interface Definitions

  - Ellipsis (...) in abstract methods and Protocol classes
  - This is correct Python syntax for interface definitions
  - Concrete implementations provide the actual logic

- Only non-actionable items remain (provider limitations and interface definitions)

### Key Design Principles Applied

1. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Consistently reused existing implementations and patterns
2. **Real implementations over mocking**: Used actual working components rather than stubs
3. **Existing pattern consistency**: Followed established patterns in the codebase
4. **Gradual enhancement**: Built incrementally on existing code rather than wholesale replacement

### Technical Approach

- **Builder**: Implemented execution by leveraging existing `ExecutionEngine` and `ExecutionContext` classes
- **Resource Management**: Integrated with existing `ResourceManager` using proper owner tracking and lifecycle management  
- **LLM Providers**: Created `SyncProviderAdapter` for async-to-sync wrapping and updated resource methods to use provider system
- **Streaming**: Added `BasicStreamProcessor`, `MemoryStreamSource`, and `MemoryStreamSink` following existing database streaming patterns
- **File Processing**: Implemented proper logic for validation, filtering, transformation, and aggregation code generation with comprehensive unit tests
- **I/O Providers**: Added `SyncDatabaseProvider` and `SyncHTTPProvider` with full sync interface support  
- **Simple API**: Added timeout handling using ThreadPoolExecutor for sync operations and asyncio.wait_for for async operations
- **Exception Handling**: Added specific FSM exception types (`CircuitBreakerError`, `ETLError`, `BulkheadTimeoutError`) and replaced generic Exception usage
- **Database Storage Factory**: Replaced hardcoded AsyncMemoryDatabase with proper AsyncDatabaseFactory supporting all dataknobs_data backends

## Final Status

**✅ Total Items Completed: 22+ items**
- 10 high priority items (100%)
- 6 medium priority items (100%)
- 6+ low priority items (100%)

**ℹ️ Non-Actionable Items: 2 categories**
- Provider limitations (by design)
