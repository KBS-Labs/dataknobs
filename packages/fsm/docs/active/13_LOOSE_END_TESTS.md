# FSM Package - Loose End Implementation Tests Checklist

This document tracks the test coverage needed for the completed loose end implementations documented in `11_LOOSE_ENDS.md`. Each completed feature needs comprehensive testing to ensure it works correctly.

**Created**: December 2024  
**Status**: 6 of 10 test suites completed, 4 remaining  
**Overall Test Coverage**: 18% (Target: 80%+) - Note: Overall coverage appears low due to many unused pattern/library files

## Test Implementation Priority

### 🔴 Critical Priority (Coverage < 40%)
These have very low coverage and are critical functionality.

### 🟡 High Priority (Coverage 40-70%)
These need significant improvement to ensure reliability.

### 🟢 Medium Priority (Coverage > 70%)
These have reasonable coverage but need specific edge cases tested.

### Test Implementation Guidelines

1. **Use Real Implementations**: Follow DRY principle, avoid excessive mocking
2. **Test Edge Cases**: Focus on error paths and boundary conditions
3. **Performance Tests**: Include tests for large datasets where relevant
4. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions, not just units
5. **Documentation**: Add docstrings explaining what each test validates

### Success Metrics

- [75%] Overall test coverage > 80% (Currently at 75%)
- [✅] All critical components > 90% coverage 
- [✅] Zero failing tests in CI/CD pipeline (130 tests passing)
- [✅] All edge cases documented and tested for completed suites
- [⏸️] Performance benchmarks established (Partial - for completed suites)

### Resources Required

- Mock servers for HTTP testing (httpbin.org or local mock)
- Test databases (in-memory sqlite)
- Sample data files for streaming tests
- Mock LLM responses for provider tests

---

## Notes

- The `execution/common.py` test suite serves as a template for comprehensive testing
- Focus on integration tests that verify the loose ends work together
- Prioritize tests that verify the DRY principle improvements
- Each test file should follow the pattern established in `test_execution_common.py`
