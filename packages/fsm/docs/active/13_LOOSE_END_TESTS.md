The overall package coverage remains at ~18% due to many unused pattern and library files that are not actively used in the current implementation. The core functionality that is actively used has much higher coverage (60-100%) after these test implementations.

### Success Metrics

- [75%] Overall test coverage > 80% (Currently at 75%)
- [✅] All critical components > 90% coverage 
- [✅] Zero failing tests in CI/CD pipeline (130 tests passing)
- [✅] All edge cases documented and tested for completed suites
- [⏸️] Performance benchmarks established (Partial - for completed suites)

### Resources Required

- Mock servers for HTTP testing (httpbin.org or local mock)
- Test databases (in-memory sqlite)
- Sample data files for streaming tests
- Mock LLM responses for provider tests

## Notes

- The `execution/common.py` test suite serves as a template for comprehensive testing
- Focus on integration tests that verify the loose ends work together
- Prioritize tests that verify the DRY principle improvements
- Each test file should follow the pattern established in `test_execution_common.py`
