## Current Issues to Resolve

### High Priority
1. **Transition Execution Failures** (4 tests failing)
   - Arcs are found but execution fails
   - Need to debug ArcExecution.execute method

2. **BatchExecutor API Mismatch** (4 tests failing)
   - Parameter naming inconsistency
   - Need to align with SimpleFSM expectations

3. **StreamExecutor API Mismatch** (1 test failing)
   - Similar parameter naming issues
   - Need to align with SimpleFSM

### Medium Priority
1. **Validation Functionality** (1 test failing)
   - Schema validation not working correctly
   - Need to fix validation logic

2. **Async/Sync Consistency**
   - Some methods still have mixed expectations
   - Need systematic review

### Low Priority
1. **Code Duplication**
   - Some common patterns repeated
   - Could benefit from refactoring

2. **Error Messages**
   - Could be more descriptive
   - Need better error context

## Key Architectural Decisions Made

1. **Dual Arc Format Support**: Support both network-level and state-level arc definitions
2. **Async-First Design**: Core execution is async with sync wrappers
3. **Resource Provider Pattern**: Flexible resource management through providers
4. **Pydantic Validation**: Strong typing for configurations
5. **Real Implementation Testing**: Minimal mocking in tests

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Fix test failures)
1. Debug and fix transition execution in ExecutionEngine
2. Align BatchExecutor parameter names
3. Align StreamExecutor parameter names
4. Fix validation functionality

### Short-term (Complete Phase 7)
1. Fix all remaining test failures
2. Complete API documentation
3. Add more integration tests
4. Create API usage examples

### Medium-term (Phases 8-9)
1. Implement monitoring and observability
2. Add metrics collection
3. Implement checkpointing
4. Add state persistence

### Long-term (Phase 10)
1. Performance optimization
2. Security review
3. Comprehensive documentation
4. Production deployment tools

## Testing Status

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: ~80% coverage
- **Integration Tests**: ~60% coverage (12/22 passing)
- **End-to-End Tests**: Basic coverage
- **Performance Tests**: Not yet implemented

### Test Results (Latest Run)
```
Total: 22 tests
Passed: 12 tests (54.5%)
Failed: 10 tests (45.5%)

Failed Categories:
- Transition Execution: 4 tests
- Batch Processing: 4 tests
- Stream Processing: 1 test
- Validation: 1 test

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
1. **Async Complexity**: Mixed sync/async APIs causing integration issues
2. **Performance**: Not yet optimized for large-scale processing
3. **Memory Usage**: Stream processing may need optimization

### Project Risks
1. **Test Coverage**: Some edge cases not covered
2. **Documentation**: API documentation incomplete
3. **Production Readiness**: Needs hardening for production use

## Conclusion

The FSM implementation is approximately 75% complete with core functionality working. The main remaining work involves:
1. Fixing the remaining test failures (immediate priority)
2. Completing API documentation
3. Implementing monitoring and observability
4. Adding production-ready features

The architecture is sound and the key design decisions have proven effective. The main challenges have been around API consistency and async/sync coordination, which are being systematically addressed.
