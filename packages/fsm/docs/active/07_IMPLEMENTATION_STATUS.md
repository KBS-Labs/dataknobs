## Next Steps

### Phase 9: Advanced Features (Priority 1)
1. **Checkpointing**
   - State snapshots
   - Resume from checkpoint
   - Checkpoint storage backends

2. **State Persistence**
   - Durable state storage
   - Recovery mechanisms
   - State versioning

3. **Distributed Execution**
   - Multi-node execution
   - State synchronization
   - Distributed coordination

## Recently Resolved Issues ✅

### ✅ Completed: API Refactoring (10_API_TO_GENERAL_REFACTOR.md)
- **Issue**: Code duplication between Simple and Advanced APIs
- **Solution**: 
  - Created ContextFactory for centralized context creation
  - Created ResultFormatter for standardized result formatting
  - Enhanced ExecutionContext with get_complete_path() method
  - Added ResourceManager factory methods
  - Improved FSM core state resolution methods
- **Result**: Zero code duplication, improved maintainability, test coverage: ContextFactory 83%, ResultFormatter 100%

### ✅ Fixed: Transition Execution Failures
- **Issue**: Arcs found but execution failed due to state tracking problems
- **Solution**: Fixed dual state tracking (string name + StateInstance) in ExecutionContext
- **Result**: All transition execution tests now pass

### ✅ Fixed: Arc Name Filtering
- **Issue**: Named arc filtering not working consistently across sync/async engines
- **Solution**: Implemented arc_name parameter support in both execution engines
- **Result**: Arc filtering functionality working correctly

### ✅ Fixed: Function Registration Issues  
- **Issue**: Inline function compilation and registration failures
- **Solution**: Enhanced function registration system and config handling
- **Result**: Function-related tests now pass

### ✅ Fixed: Config Format Support
- **Issue**: Legacy pre_test format not supported
- **Solution**: Enhanced config loader to handle format transformations
- **Result**: Config compatibility improved

### ✅ Fixed: StateTransform vs ArcTransform Execution Pipeline
- **Issue**: Confusion between StateTransforms and ArcTransforms causing:
  - ArcTransforms not being executed during transitions
  - Incorrect function registration patterns
  - Duplicate StateTransform execution
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Execution engine passing dictionary instead of FunctionRegistry to ArcExecution
  - ArcTransform functions stored in `transforms` registry but engine only looking in `functions`
  - StateTransforms being executed twice (in state functions + state transforms phases)
- **Solution**: 
  - **Clarified Concepts**: StateTransforms (state entry) vs ArcTransforms (arc traversal)
  - **Fixed Function Registry Access**: Pass FunctionRegistry object to ArcExecution with `get_function()` method
  - **Maintained Backward Compatibility**: ArcExecution accepts both FunctionRegistry and dict
  - **Eliminated Duplicate Execution**: Removed transform execution from `_execute_state_functions`
  - **Enhanced Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive tests for both transform types
- **Result**: 
  - Both StateTransforms and ArcTransforms execute correctly in proper sequence
  - Clear execution order: Input → StateTransform → State Processing → ArcTransform → Next State
  - No duplicate transform execution
  - All tests passing including new separation tests

## Key Architectural Decisions Made

1. **Dual Arc Format Support**: Support both network-level and state-level arc definitions
2. **Async-First Design**: Core execution is async with sync wrappers
3. **Resource Provider Pattern**: Flexible resource management through providers
4. **Pydantic Validation**: Strong typing for configurations
5. **Real Implementation Testing**: Minimal mocking in tests

## Next Steps

### Project Risks
1. **Test Coverage**: Some edge cases not covered
2. **Documentation**: API documentation incomplete
3. **Production Readiness**: Needs hardening for production use

## Conclusion

The FSM implementation is approximately 80% complete with all core functionality working, comprehensive testing, and example documentation. Phase 8 (Testing and Documentation) has been successfully completed. The main remaining work involves:

1. **Phase 9: Advanced Features** - Checkpointing, state persistence, distributed execution
2. **Phase 10: Production Readiness** - Performance optimization, security hardening, monitoring
3. **Additional Documentation** - API reference, user guides, more examples

**Recent Accomplishments:**
