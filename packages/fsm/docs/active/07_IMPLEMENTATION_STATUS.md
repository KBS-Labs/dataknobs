## Current Issues to Resolve

### High Priority
1. **API Code Duplication** (Refactoring needed)
   - SimpleFSM and AdvancedFSM contain duplicated logic
   - Resource creation patterns repeated
   - Context initialization patterns duplicated
   - Result formatting logic duplicated
   - Need systematic refactoring to move logic to general level
   - Reference: 10_API_TO_GENERAL_REFACTOR.md

### Medium Priority  
1. **API Documentation**
   - Complete API reference documentation needed
   - Usage examples required
   - Integration guides missing

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Some operations may benefit from optimization
   - Memory usage could be improved for large-scale processing

### Low Priority
1. **Error Messages**
   - Could be more descriptive in some cases
   - Need better error context for debugging

2. **Test Coverage**
   - Additional edge case testing would be beneficial
   - Performance benchmarking tests needed

## Recently Resolved Issues ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ Fixed: Transition Execution Failures
- **Issue**: Arcs found but execution failed due to state tracking problems
- **Solution**: Fixed dual state tracking (string name + StateInstance) in ExecutionContext
- **Result**: All transition execution tests now pass

### ‚úÖ Fixed: Arc Name Filtering
- **Issue**: Named arc filtering not working consistently across sync/async engines
- **Solution**: Implemented arc_name parameter support in both execution engines
- **Result**: Arc filtering functionality working correctly

### ‚úÖ Fixed: Function Registration Issues  
- **Issue**: Inline function compilation and registration failures
- **Solution**: Enhanced function registration system and config handling
- **Result**: Function-related tests now pass

### ‚úÖ Fixed: Config Format Support
- **Issue**: Legacy pre_test format not supported
- **Solution**: Enhanced config loader to handle format transformations
- **Result**: Config compatibility improved

## Key Architectural Decisions Made

1. **Dual Arc Format Support**: Support both network-level and state-level arc definitions
2. **Async-First Design**: Core execution is async with sync wrappers
3. **Resource Provider Pattern**: Flexible resource management through providers
4. **Pydantic Validation**: Strong typing for configurations
5. **Real Implementation Testing**: Minimal mocking in tests

## Next Steps

### Immediate (API Refactoring - Priority 1)
1. Create ContextFactory to centralize context initialization patterns
2. Create ResultFormatter to eliminate result formatting duplication  
3. Enhance ResourceManager with factory methods
4. Standardize engine lifecycle management across APIs
5. Move state resolution logic to FSM core
6. Refactor Simple and Advanced APIs to use centralized infrastructure
7. Reference: 10_API_TO_GENERAL_REFACTOR.md for detailed plan

### Short-term (Complete Phase 7)
1. Complete API refactoring (above)
2. Complete API documentation
3. Add more integration tests  
4. Create API usage examples

### Medium-term (Phases 8-9)
1. Implement monitoring and observability
2. Add metrics collection
3. Implement checkpointing
4. Add state persistence

### Long-term (Phase 10)
1. Performance optimization
2. Security review
3. Comprehensive documentation
4. Production deployment tools

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
1. **Async Complexity**: Mixed sync/async APIs causing integration issues
2. **Performance**: Not yet optimized for large-scale processing
3. **Memory Usage**: Stream processing may need optimization

### Project Risks
1. **Test Coverage**: Some edge cases not covered
2. **Documentation**: API documentation incomplete
3. **Production Readiness**: Needs hardening for production use

## Conclusion

The FSM implementation is approximately 85% complete with all core functionality working and API tests passing. The main remaining work involves:
1. API refactoring to eliminate code duplication (immediate priority)
2. Completing API documentation  
3. Implementing monitoring and observability
4. Adding production-ready features

The architecture is sound and the key design decisions have proven effective. The major challenge of API consistency and execution reliability has been successfully resolved. The next focus is on code quality improvements through systematic refactoring before proceeding to advanced features.
