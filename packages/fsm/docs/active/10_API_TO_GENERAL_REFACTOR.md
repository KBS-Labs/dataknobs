# API to General Level Refactor Plan

## Overview

During the process of fixing Simple and Advanced API tests, we discovered several cases where logic had been created or repeated at the API level that should be implemented at the general execution engine level instead. This document outlines the identified areas and provides a checklist for refactoring them.

## Context

The Simple API (`src/dataknobs_fsm/api/simple.py`) and Advanced API (`src/dataknobs_fsm/api/advanced.py`) contain duplicated and API-specific logic that should be centralized in the core execution components. This refactoring will:

- Eliminate code duplication
- Improve maintainability  
- Ensure consistent behavior across all FSM usage patterns
- Reduce API-specific workarounds

## Identified Issues

### 1. Resource Provider Creation Logic (Simple API)

**Current State:**
- Location: `SimpleFSM._create_resource_provider()` and `SimpleFSM._create_simple_resource_provider()` (lines 414-436)
- Issue: Simple API duplicates resource creation logic that should be centralized

**Target State:**
- Move to ResourceManager with factory method for creating providers from dict configs
- Remove duplicated logic from Simple API

**Code Reference:**
```python
# Current duplication in SimpleFSM
def _create_simple_resource_provider(self, name: str, config: Dict[str, Any]):
    class SimpleResourceProvider:
        # ... implementation
```

### 2. Context Initialization Patterns (Both APIs)

**Current State:**
- Simple API: `process()` and `process_async()` methods (lines 116-133, 182-198)
- Advanced API: `execution_context()` method (lines 220-296)
- Issue: Complex context initialization logic duplicated across APIs

**Target State:**
- Create centralized `ContextFactory` class
- Enhance `ExecutionContext` constructor to handle common patterns

**Code Reference:**
```python
# Duplicated pattern in both APIs
context = ExecutionContext(
    data_mode=ProcessingMode.SINGLE,
    resources={}
)
context.data = record.to_dict()
# ... state initialization logic
```

### 3. Result Formatting Logic (Simple API)

**Current State:**
- Location: `SimpleFSM.process()` and `SimpleFSM.process_async()` (lines 143-158, 213-227)
- Issue: Identical result formatting logic duplicated between sync and async methods

**Target State:**
- Create `ResultFormatter` utility class
- Add result formatting to execution engines

**Code Reference:**
```python
# Duplicated result formatting
return {
    'final_state': context.current_state,
    'data': context.data,
    'path': context.state_history + ([context.current_state] if context.current_state else []),
    'success': success,
    'error': None if success else str(result)
}
```

### 4. State History Path Construction (Simple API)

**Current State:**
- Location: Lines 147 and 216 in result formatting
- Issue: Path construction logic duplicated and should be handled by ExecutionContext

**Target State:**
- Add `get_complete_path()` method to ExecutionContext

**Code Reference:**
```python
# Current duplicated logic
'path': context.state_history + ([context.current_state] if context.current_state else [])
```

### 5. Batch Processing Result Transformation (Simple API)

**Current State:**
- Location: `SimpleFSM.process_batch()` lines 269-289
- Issue: Hardcoded result transformation with missing functionality (TODOs)

**Target State:**
- Batch executor should return standardized results
- Create common result transformer

**Code Reference:**
```python
# Current incomplete transformation
'final_state': 'output',  # TODO: Get actual final state from context
'path': [],  # TODO: Get path from context
```

### 6. Async Engine Creation Pattern (Simple API)

**Current State:**
- Location: `SimpleFSM.process_async()` lines 201-202
- Issue: Creates async engines on-demand vs Advanced API's instance variables

**Target State:**
- Standardize engine lifecycle management across APIs

**Code Reference:**
```python
# Inconsistent engine management
from ..execution.async_engine import AsyncExecutionEngine
async_engine = AsyncExecutionEngine(self._fsm)  # Created on-demand
```

### 7. State Definition and Instance Creation (Advanced API)

**Current State:**
- Location: `AdvancedFSM.execution_context()` lines 232-284
- Issue: Complex state resolution logic with fallback handling

**Target State:**
- Move to FSM core or ExecutionContext with factory method

**Code Reference:**
```python
# Complex state resolution logic
if not state_name:
    # Find start state from FSM
    if hasattr(self.fsm, 'get_start_state'):
        state_def = self.fsm.get_start_state()
        # ... more fallback logic
```
